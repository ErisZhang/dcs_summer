+ [psu_astrostatistics_importance_sampling](psu_astrostatistics_importance_sampling.pdf)
    + a set of slides, intro to MC and importance sampling

+ [university_of_arizona_importance_sampling_tom_kennedy](university_of_arizona_importance_sampling_tom_kennedy.pdf)
    + chapter 6 of Tom Kennedy's book
    + good introduction on
        + importance sampling
        + strategy on how to pick proposal distribution `q`
        + self-normalizing IS
            + if `p` and `q` known up to an unknown constant factor
        + variance minimization
            + minimize `q` by restricting it to be in some family, `p(x, theta)`
                + exponential tiling: `q` is in exponential     family
            + consider IS as weighted MC
            + reference distribution
